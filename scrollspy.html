        <h4 id="1">1</h4>
        <p id="oneone">1 (one, unit, unity) is a number, numeral, and glyph. It is the first and smallest positive integer of the infinite
        sequence of natural numbers. This fundamental property has led to its unique uses in other fields, ranging from science
        to sports, where it commonly denotes the first, leading, or top thing in a group. 1 is the unit of counting or
        measurement, a determiner for singular nouns, and a gender-neutral pronoun. Historically, the representation of 1
        evolved from ancient Sumerian and Babylonian symbols to the modern Arabic numeral.
        
        In mathematics, 1 is the multiplicative identity, meaning that any number multiplied by 1 equals the same number. 1 is
        by convention not considered a prime number. In digital technology, 1 represents the "on" state in binary code, the
        foundation of computing. Philosophically, 1 symbolizes the ultimate reality or source of existence in various
        traditions.
        
        In mathematics
        The number 1 is the first natural number after 0. Each natural number, including 1, is constructed by succession, that
        is, by adding 1 to the previous natural number. The number 1 is the multiplicative identity of the integers, real
        numbers, and complex numbers, that is, any number
        n
        {\displaystyle n} multiplied by 1 remains unchanged (
        1
        ×
        n
        =
        n
        ×
        1
        =
        n
        {\displaystyle 1\times n=n\times 1=n}). As a result, the square (
        1
        2
        =
        1
        {\displaystyle 1^{2}=1}), square root (
        1
        =
        1
        {\displaystyle {\sqrt {1}}=1}), and any other power of 1 is always equal to 1 itself.[1] 1 is its own factorial (
        1
        !
        =
        1
        {\displaystyle 1!=1}), and 0! is also 1. These are a special case of the empty product.[2] Although 1 meets the naïve
        definition of a prime number, being evenly divisible only by 1 and itself (also 1), by modern convention it is regarded
        as neither a prime nor a composite number.[3]
        
        Different mathematical constructions of the natural numbers represent 1 in various ways. In Giuseppe Peano's original
        formulation of the Peano axioms, a set of postulates to define the natural numbers in a precise and logical way, 1 was
        treated as the starting point of the sequence of natural numbers.[4][5] Peano later revised his axioms to begin the
        sequence with 0.[4][6] In the Von Neumann cardinal assignment of natural numbers, where each number is defined as a set
        that contains all numbers before it, 1 is represented as the singleton
        {
        0
        }
        {\displaystyle \{0\}}, a set containing only the element 0.[7] The unary numeral system, as used in tallying, is an
        example of a "base-1" number system, since only one mark – the tally itself – is needed. While this is the simplest way
        to represent the natural numbers, base-1 is rarely used as a practical base for counting due to its difficult
        readability.[8][9]</p>
        <h4 id="2">2</h4>
        <p id="twotwo">2 (two) is a number, numeral and digit. It is the natural number following 1 and preceding 3. It is the smallest and the
        only even prime number.
        
        Because it forms the basis of a duality, it has religious and spiritual significance in many cultures.
        
        As a word
        Two is most commonly a determiner used with plural countable nouns, as in two days or I'll take these two.[1] Two is a
        noun when it refers to the number two as in two plus two is four.
        
        Etymology of two
        The word two is derived from the Old English words twā (feminine), tū (neuter), and twēġen (masculine, which survives
        today in the form twain).[2]
        
        The pronunciation /tuː/, like that of who, is due to the labialization of the vowel by the w, which then disappeared
        before the related sound. The successive stages of pronunciation for the Old English twā would thus be /twɑː/, /twɔː/,
        /twoː/, /twuː/, and finally /tuː/.[2]
        
        Mathematics
        An integer is determined to be even if it is divisible by two. When written in base 10, all multiples of 2 will end in
        0, 2, 4, 6, or 8;[3] more generally, in any even base, even numbers will end with an even digit. 2 is the smallest and
        the only even prime number, and the first Ramanujan prime.[4] It is also the first superior highly composite number,[5]
        and the first colossally abundant number.[6]
        
        Geometry
        A digon is a polygon with two sides (or edges) and two vertices.[7]: 52  Two distinct points in a plane are always
        sufficient to define a unique line in a nontrivial Euclidean space.[8]</p>
        <h4 id="one">one</h4>
        <p id="one">One originates from the Old English word an, derived from the Germanic root *ainaz, from the Proto-Indo-European root
        *oi-no- (meaning "one, unique").[16] Linguistically, one is a cardinal number used for counting and expressing the
        number of items in a collection of things.[17] One is most commonly a determiner used with singular countable nouns, as
        in one day at a time.[18] The determiner has two senses: numerical one (I have one apple) and singulative one (one day
        I'll do it).[19] One is also a gender-neutral pronoun used to refer to an unspecified person or to people in general as
        in one should take care of oneself.[20]
        
        Words that derive their meaning from one include alone, which signifies all one in the sense of being by oneself, none
        meaning not one, once denoting one time, and atone meaning to become at one with the someone. Combining alone with only
        (implying one-like) leads to lonely, conveying a sense of solitude.[21] Other common numeral prefixes for the number 1
        include uni- (e.g., unicycle, universe, unicorn), sol- (e.g., solo dance), derived from Latin, or mono- (e.g., monorail,
        monogamy, monopoly) derived from Greek.[22][23]
        
        Symbols and representation
        History
        See also: History of the Hindu–Arabic numeral system
        Among the earliest known records of a numeral system, is the Sumerian decimal-sexagesimal system on clay tablets dating
        from the first half of the third millennium BCE.[24] Archaic Sumerian numerals for 1 and 60 both consisted of horizontal
        semi-circular symbols, [25] by c. 2350 BCE, the older Sumerian curviform numerals were replaced with cuneiform symbols,
        with 1 and 60 both represented by the same mostly vertical symbol.</p>
        <h4 id="two">Two</h4>
        <p id="two">The digit used in the modern Western world to represent the number 2 traces its roots back to the Indic Brahmic script,
        where "2" was written as two horizontal lines. The modern Chinese and Japanese languages (and Korean Hanja) still use
        this method. The Gupta script rotated the two lines 45 degrees, making them diagonal. The top line was sometimes also
        shortened and had its bottom end curve towards the center of the bottom line. In the Nagari script, the top line was
        written more like a curve connecting to the bottom line. In the Arabic Ghubar writing, the bottom line was completely
        vertical, and the digit looked like a dotless closing question mark. Restoring the bottom line to its original
        horizontal position, but keeping the top line as a curve that connects to the bottom line leads to our modern digit.[11]</p>
        <h4 id="three">three</h4>
        <p id="three">The use of three lines to denote the number 3 occurred in many writing systems, including some (like Roman and Chinese
        numerals) that are still in use. That was also the original representation of 3 in the Brahmic (Indian) numerical
        notation, its earliest forms aligned vertically.[2] However, during the Gupta Empire the sign was modified by the
        addition of a curve on each line. The Nāgarī script rotated the lines clockwise, so they appeared horizontally, and
        ended each line with a short downward stroke on the right. In cursive script, the three strokes were eventually
        connected to form a glyph resembling a ⟨3⟩ with an additional stroke at the bottom: ३.
        
        The Indian digits spread to the Caliphate in the 9th century. The bottom stroke was dropped around the 10th century in
        the western parts of the Caliphate, such as the Maghreb and Al-Andalus, when a distinct variant ("Western Arabic") of
        the digit symbols developed, including modern Western 3. In contrast, the Eastern Arabs retained and enlarged that
        stroke, rotating the digit once more to yield the modern ("Eastern") Arabic digit "٣".[3]</p>
